To be frank, while I am indeed reviewing many aspects of Adventure Time, this is really mostly just an over-glorified semi-organized praise-rant-tribute that emphasizes solely on all the things I&amp;#39;ve recently come to love the most about it. Because even though there are multiple things I can criticize with the show, I&amp;#39;m so drunk on the euphoria of it just finishing that I simply cannot bring myself to point out any of its flaws or mistakes. Of course, while I do believe this is a quite extensive analysis compared to what I initially planned, it&amp;#39;s honestly little more than an incredibly emotional vent that focuses only on the positive things about the show. So if you were intending to read through this only for an unbiased, objective analysis of Adventure Time, I will take absolutely no offense if you turn away now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, on with the thicc-ass rant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tawqn9vbsx051.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9dce595d5b5c950279258a26cdecb82174cd723a&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tawqn9vbsx051.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9dce595d5b5c950279258a26cdecb82174cd723a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lore, oh my Glob, THE LORE!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, I feel like the very first thing I just have to say about Adventure Time is its indisputably godly world-building. Even with that specific aspect in mind, I can hardly find where to begin. Hardly any Western cartoon I know comes close to the sheer vastness of AT&amp;#39;s massive universe, or at least does nearly as well in drawing interest to it. One of my most favorite parts of the show is its complex, multi-layered dystopian backstory and how it&amp;#39;s filled with all sorts of mysteries and adventures ready to be explored. The mystery around the series&amp;#39; post-apocalyptic setting is absolutely breathtaking. It becomes clear from the start that this world is much, much bigger than the main characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And what I especially cannot get over is how exactly AT reveals this world to the audience. You don&amp;#39;t actually realize the dystopian in the beginning, but after a few episodes you start to realize the ruins of modern-day roads and skyscrapers littered here and there, the giant crater in Earth, and occasional flashbacks referring to post-apocalyptic events. Once I did realize it, every detail that seemed to tie in with it never ceased to keep me at the edge of my seat. The lore is slowly uncovered and explained little by little through many different backstories, origins, and various other elements episode by episode, sometimes taking a peek millennia into the future and other times delving into the thick mysteries of the past. It stretches over countless points in time and space. Each episode adds to the massive, unending jigsaw puzzle that is AT&amp;#39;s universe, building it piece by piece, with each piece shown through the perspectives of many different characters and the events that surround them, even in the smallest of details. It rarely ever leans on plain exposition and instead masterfully hints at events or briefly mentions them at various points throughout the series, giving the audience the immense satisfaction of connecting the dots by themselves. (And I&amp;#39;m not talking about a few unrelated references sprinkled here and there, there are more than enough to make a seasoned easter egg-hunter orgasm.) And as more and more is revealed, you start to see how it all so satisfyingly relates and connects with each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9n9ez7g6tx051.jpg?width=310&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1738291352a8065acf5075735dc9e07e9db14932&quot;&gt;The devastation caused by the Mushroom War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing you&amp;#39;d notice from AT is how, the first few seasons and episodes are nearly entirely made up of just random silly adventures and one-shot stories to entertain the kids. Similar to episodic, &amp;quot;anthology&amp;quot; shows such as Rick and Morty, the beginning of the show is filled with seemingly unrelated events and stories. But soon, after a few seasons or so, all these events and adventures start to connect with each other and slowly but surely merge into a single cohesive plotline at the center of the show&amp;#39;s story. Soon, the series starts to show the world- and character-building really starts to show as the characters get involved in much more serious and &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; conflicts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, yes, this is a formula that could easily be seen in many other plot-driven western cartoons. Gravity Falls, Steven Universe, Star Vs. the Forces of Evil, the list goes on. And all I can say about it is, personally, it never gets old. Besides, in AT it often seems to happen much more gradually. There are a lot of filler episodes, but if you&amp;#39;re patient, it all pays off. The further into the show you go, the more you realize the gradual decrease in filler and the increase in more plot-driven episodes. You become quite accustomed to the chill, silly fillers that once the serious episodes start to kick into high gear, they pack a much bigger punch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/sfyglo01xx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0ec65cc40ec10eeaa5f1985908e8042d7d43d851&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/sfyglo01xx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0ec65cc40ec10eeaa5f1985908e8042d7d43d851&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT eventually grew and developed from its more silly, carefree episodes to much more story-driven, heavy plotlines. And, while my extremely limited research has pointed to several people seeing that as a decline of the show, I could not disagree more. I love the more &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; episodes much more and even feel like I grew up with them as they transitioned from random goofy adventures to actual serious conflicts, and it&amp;#39;s nice to see how the characters developed. I believe it didn&amp;#39;t decline in quality, but simply experienced a change in tone--a change that I&amp;#39;m more than on board with. The show started building a wonderful world with continuity and serious lore biz. They&amp;#39;re developing characters from being one dimensional like they were in the first few seasons into very complex, relatable, fully-fledged characters. I personally become more excited for episodes and pay more attention to the details to see what it could mean to the story as a whole. And I really don&amp;#39;t see how anyone could take that as a decline in quality. (Again, I researched next to nothing on this and didn&amp;#39;t watch the show that critically, so please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to destroy my arguments by telling me what people mean by AT&amp;#39;s decline in quality if you do know UwU).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those really into world-building and are interested in checking out AT, I highly recommend speed-binging through all the episodes (I like to take a break between seasons to pace it out more), fearlessly scrutinizing all the details, and not watching anything else while you&amp;#39;re at it, so that you can fully absorb all the details and references among episodes. (feel very, very free to private message me for a list of all the essential plot-related episodes if you don&amp;#39;t like filler and wanna cut down the watch time by about 40%).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite its impressive lore, Adventure Time still has a lot of heart, and its world-building and character-building go hand in hand seamlessly. As I&amp;#39;ve said before, the show matured over time, and many of the characters matured along with it. Each backstory, origin story, and plot element resonates richly with themes of friendship, heroism, love, as well as grief, trauma, and suffering. One episode you would be chuckling at some silly adventure and another episode you would be crying your eyes out. AT combines surrealism with heart, addressing our angsts and hopes and what it means to be alive. In contrast to its at-a-glance childlike appearance, it&amp;#39;s full of progressive, grown-up themes. In the words of its creator, Pendelton Ward, “It’s candyland on the surface and dark underneath, and that’s why it’s compelling, I think.” There are also plenty of episodes dedicated to fleshing out and developing particular characters&amp;#39; arcs and relationships, allowing them to grow and have the audience more attached and empathized with them. Before you know it, you&amp;#39;ve become incredibly emotionally attached and invested in the lives of all these characters, you feel as if you might as well live among them and experience what they do. And nothing proves this more than the devastatingly bittersweet emotions that grip your heart as you finally leave all those characters at the series finale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a vast array of different character dynamics that ensure the audience never gets bored, whether characters are going on some carefree, silly adventure, forming long-lasting affections towards each other, or uncovering deep, existential truths about their past. While I definitely have my favorites, each character is unique in their own special way that really adds to the show&amp;#39;s diversity and color. For all of its world-building, AT would be dull and empty without the many distinct personalities of its characters and their interactions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/w378emj0ux051.png?width=940&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80d6e163d919c08e51b674787cf7ee30a057d3ab&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/w378emj0ux051.png?width=940&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80d6e163d919c08e51b674787cf7ee30a057d3ab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several character development arcs that really stick with me throughout the show. But off the top of my head, my favorite is probably the &amp;quot;Islands&amp;quot; miniseries. I don&amp;#39;t wanna go too in-depth about this, since I could probably make a whole separate review specifically on it, but I feel like it&amp;#39;s probably one of the best examples of the show&amp;#39;s integration of character development into its world-building. We finally get information about what happened to all of the humans and the mystery behind Finn being the supposed last human in Ooo, and the characters even explore lands beyond Ooo itself. Multiple series of flashbacks, dreams, and visions slowly unfold the post-apocalyptic events of the past, depicting various recurring existential themes, and yet large parts of it remain unexplained to constantly keep the audience wondering. But at the same time, we get to witness and empathize with the strong, conflicting emotions within Finn as he learns the story behind his parents and his past. I&amp;#39;m especially fond of the scene where Finn says &amp;quot;I know about helping people&amp;quot; and thrusts his hand into the machine thingy to show his &amp;quot;digitalized&amp;quot; mother all his past experiences of helping those around him. This scene shows just how much Finn&amp;#39;s character has developed over the show, culminating and building on all his past character developments, while also truly establishing how he sees Ooo as his true home and his strong connection with all his friends. All this deep characterization and messages about friendship, heroism, and home displayed beautifully in under 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wtr1j4gltx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=287b4a19839963e06c15435283bf7250a3b9c9d6&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wtr1j4gltx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=287b4a19839963e06c15435283bf7250a3b9c9d6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adventure time is known for being Cartoon Network&amp;#39;s weirdest show, and that couldn&amp;#39;t be more true. It is irrepressibly creative, whether in storytelling, character design, or any other aspects. Some might even describe it as &amp;quot;experimental&amp;quot;, especially nearing the later seasons, with many episodes being shown in new, different ways and styles that make it difficult to get bored of. People often refer to it as “trippy”, which isn’t a surprise due to its absurdity, fantastical elements, and apparent randomness. But the show is really more than that. Adventure Time is certainly surreal, but it adheres to a deeper, more earnest kind of surrealism that is distinct from some inchoate sense of oddity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One cool thing about it, though, is how it seems to treat all these crazy occurrences with a &amp;quot;casual air of indifference&amp;quot;. This is a very hard and subjective thing for me to describe, but I have this specific liking towards shows with weird, supernatural elements but with characters that react to it in such a unique way. I guess I could even say this is one of the things that I like more about my favorite western cartoons than any anime I&amp;#39;ve ever watched. Not to say I used to hate anime or anything, but before I really got into it, I was always especially ticked off by how &amp;quot;overexaggerated&amp;quot; and dramatic the characters seemed to act to just about everything. (I know not all anime are like this but this is mostly from my premature exposure to all the slice of life anime my weeb friends watched that ended up being the way I saw most anime). This even made me uncomfortable in western cartoons that implemented Japanese influences, like the OG Teen Titans show (still love it to death tho).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/itg673ku0y051.gif&quot;&gt;https://i.redd.it/itg673ku0y051.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the difference with Adventure Time is how most of the characters seem to act so chill about everything. This is probably just a weird and stupid whim of mine that I apply inconsistently to the media I&amp;#39;ve watched, but I somehow find much more of an appeal when, for instance, a huge life-changing supernatural event happens in someone&amp;#39;s life and they just shrug it off as if it&amp;#39;s something they deal with every day of their lives. I don&amp;#39;t know how he does it but the specific personalities Pendleton Ward imbues into all his characters in even the tiniest reactions to things just makes me enjoy those kinds of characters so much. It&amp;#39;s gone to the point where it&amp;#39;s even shaped my own personality and made me want to experience all the freaky supernatural stuff they do every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I just have to bring up the blessing upon this world that is Marceline the Vampire Queen. To quote a friend, I don&amp;#39;t understand how a character could be so visually plain in physical design but still so generally hot. Go ahead, chew me out for having a thing for edgy tsunderes, but believe me when I say her character arc is probably one of the best in the whole series. Her traumatic past, conflicts between being good and bad, and interaction with others has made her stand out more to me time and again. And her relationship with Simon over the centuries as well as the immense pain of having him slowly drift into madness was always one of the parts of AT that rang closest to my heart even when I was first watching it when I was 9 years old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/r84ayzu8vx051.png?width=733&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e21205a9dbafe0ed2b6e4049390a10a4f57b6e1&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/r84ayzu8vx051.png?width=733&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e21205a9dbafe0ed2b6e4049390a10a4f57b6e1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SPECIFIC RANT ON THE SERIES FINALE, &amp;quot;COME ALONG WITH ME&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As cliché as they may be, I am an absolute sucker for epic final showdown battles where all the main and supporting characters join forces and take a final stand against their biggest enemy. Like, imagine fights such as those at the end of Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, battles that absolutely fill the screen and with each main character getting his or her own special moment onscreen. I squealed with utter glee when most of the recurring supporting cast in AT all entered the screen to face GOLB together in the final battle for Ooo, culminating in the most conclusive, ultimate clash of good and evil. This is where all the long processes of individual character developments and relationships over the course of 10 long seasons finally pay off, and every major character truly feels like a real person with real emotional significance that you relate a lot to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ft97qxaovx051.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=65aab3691876419d5f0d2d5c4ba9425dd9afb97a&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ft97qxaovx051.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=65aab3691876419d5f0d2d5c4ba9425dd9afb97a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all of that is truly a huge contribution to my enjoyment of the finale, however, what really amazed me about the ending was how there were able to actually tie everything together. As I was entering the final season I actually checked back on all the previous seasons several times because I thought I had skipped a season or two, since there were so many plotlines, possibilities, and loose ends still left unanswered. As I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, adventure time has an amazingly vast world-building and many different events occurring at once, events that they don&amp;#39;t always fully explain and oftentimes only hint at. The Lich, Orgalorg, Fern&amp;#39;s spider parasite thingy, the Founders of the Islands: just to name a few out of many, many more &amp;quot;partially loose ends&amp;quot; that we still don&amp;#39;t have that much detailed information about who they are and where they came from. And as I got closer and closer to the finale, little of these loose ends were actually ever brought up again, and out of the many equally interesting mysteries to choose from for its finale, AT only seemed to lean closer and closer towards one of them: the Gum War. (In the end, GOLB became the main issue of the finale, and he only ever made like 5 small appearances over the past 10 seasons). So I kept wondering (and even worrying) how it was gonna squeeze in and conclude all these mysteries that still haven&amp;#39;t been fully explained. The answer: it simply did not. It still managed to pay sufficient homage to many of these mysteries without spending more than a few seconds with each, which was wonderful to see. But for the most part, it left unexplained all the things that weren&amp;#39;t fully explained, which, now that I think about it, was probably the best move for it to make. It made sure that the show didn&amp;#39;t over-bloat itself in attempting to address all of its lore, as all good stories must come to an end. And as much as I would really love to see the world-building fleshed out even more than it is, I love how it leaves an element of mystery, and, again, invites the audience to theorize and wonder for themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, WHY DID I HAVE TO GET SPOILED FOR BUBBLEGUM AND MARCELINE&amp;#39;S KISS SKJFSDKJFHSDFHSDLKJFHSL. Words cannot express how happy I am for them. This is absolutely beautiful. I could tell AT has been building up to this for seasons, and I love how well Bubblegum and Marceline’s relationship has been developed episode by episode. Even though I don’t advocate for LGBTQ, I believe this is a great example of LGBTQ representation in children’s entertainment, being unabashedly positive, confident, and portrayed through amazing characters. It doesn’t feel out of place or fan-service-y and shows how they truly care for each other, reflecting their connection with each other over hundreds of years in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n97nw8mvvx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a00423835cc3b69255d137b3ec060d8c7ff31ac&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n97nw8mvvx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a00423835cc3b69255d137b3ec060d8c7ff31ac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also have to mention the genius of the last episode being set hundreds of years into the future and the final battle actually being a story being told by BMO at that point in time. It allowed for many characters, settings, and other elements to be shown far into the future after having changed over time, which I personally love to see in a series. That way, despite being the last episode, it expanded the show&amp;#39;s lore even further through all its references and easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, however, the show closed with a bittersweet conclusion that focuses less on lore or spectacle but instead on the series&amp;#39; profound message of fellowship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although there are plenty of songs in AT, I was never really into the show for the songs as much as I was for, say, Steven Universe (except for all of Marceline&amp;#39;s songs they have to make an album for all of them uninterrupted I swear to Glob). But I make a huge exception for the series finale&amp;#39;s use of songs in ending the show. BMO&amp;#39;s song, &amp;quot;Time Adventure&amp;quot;, brought tears to my eyes as, more awesomely than any amount of lore, it portrayed the show&amp;#39;s profound message of fellowship that it had been telling from the very beginning. It was an ingeniously simple yet beautiful way to simultaneously defeat GOLB and encapsulate the closeness between all the characters. The song unites all the major characters, showing how they’re connected through all their adventures together. Even if those adventures may be lost to the past they’re still happening, just at a different point in time--they’ll never be limited by the constraints of time. It shows how, no matter what they go through, their friendship will happen, is happening, and has always happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wvt9yrrbwx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=315d007a35e8211b1ad5e6f427f071645181c168&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wvt9yrrbwx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=315d007a35e8211b1ad5e6f427f071645181c168&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I feel like the “Time Adventure” song speaks directly to those watching the series finale and are sad about the show ending. It tells us that “it seems unforgiving when a good thing ends”, as all the characters and events of Adventure Time are about to move to the past for us as the series comes to a close. But Adventure Time, just like all events, will always be happening “back then”. It will always remain in our hearts as memories of the past that we can always revisit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, as touched as I was by BMO’s song, I was even more so by The Island Song (the “Come Along with Me” song) at the very end of the finale. The best way to describe how it affected me is to quote Music Hole: it expresses a really specific feeling that&amp;#39;s hard to describe. As the finale comes to an end, AT provides some final bittersweet closure in its montage of several different characters and the different experiences they’re leading now, showing all the different “collections” of their adventures. It invites you to truly come along with all those characters on an unforgettable, timeless adventure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ua6d1mcpwx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47a8817e56dd3b9fa4d732711774edf54d93ae0f&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ua6d1mcpwx051.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47a8817e56dd3b9fa4d732711774edf54d93ae0f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One more thing I have to say about AT is its specific blend of genres and archetypes that I am especially attracted to. I think I&amp;#39;ve finally found out the specific pattern that I like to see the most in all the things I’ve watched recently. I&amp;#39;m drawn to the prospect of the abnormal, anything out of the ordinary and different from the real world. Anything related to fantasy, sci-fi, or the supernatural would be enough to wow me into watching the entire show. BUT at the same time I love it when that fantasy is combined with beautiful character dynamics and relationships, be it friendship, brotherhood, parental love, or even romance. And I now understand how this well-balanced blend between fantasy world-building and characterization hooked me most in other media I&amp;#39;ve consumed, but it isn&amp;#39;t until witnessing it in all its glory in AT that I truly realized it. The show throws all sorts of weird and supernatural wonders at you, but its characters are all human enough to make it feel real. You laugh with them, cry with them, fight alongside them. And this enables you to experience all the supernatural adventures they do. It becomes a personal journey. I watched this one special where the show&amp;#39;s creator, Pendleton Ward, explains how his main goal was to make the audience feel what the characters felt, and I truly applaud him for achieving that goal so well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I technically did watch lots of AT as it was airing when I was still around 8-10 years old, I’d only recently decided to seriously “re-watch” it from beginning to end, and as this rant should well prove, I now see it in a very different light. It’s become so much more than the goofy kiddie show I once saw it as and now holds a special place in my heart. I took this show in extremely slowly, “re-watching” it over the course of nearly half a year by sort of “slowly binging” it. I very slowly immersed myself in it to the point that it simply felt like another part of my life and I was convinced it would never end, so that when I finally arrived at the last two seasons I was shocked with how little I had left to watch. For some time I’ve already been preparing myself for the all-too-familiar shockwave of depression and loss to hit after the show ends, and yet it still hurts like hell. But just as the “Time Adventure” song says, it will always remain as memories of “back then”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still though, suffice to say, I will never get used to the feeling of witnessing the tearful fulfillment of a wholesome ending whole at the same time suffering the sheer melancholy of having it end at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But hey Distant Lands coming soon so yeeeeee&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zjfjbng0sx051.jpg?width=266&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b3045d5d2b9b526b0ca1d33b1e29062d3857f3b&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zjfjbng0sx051.jpg?width=266&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b3045d5d2b9b526b0ca1d33b1e29062d3857f3b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/SoldMySoul4Wifi&quot;&gt; /u/SoldMySoul4Wifi &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gqerex/spoilers_rewatched_adventure_time_from_beginning/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gqerex/spoilers_rewatched_adventure_time_from_beginning/&quot;&gt;[comentarios]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_gqerex</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gqerex/spoilers_rewatched_adventure_time_from_beginning/" /><updated>2020-05-25T17:05:11+00:00</updated><title>[SPOILERS] Re-watched Adventure Time from beginning to end as a 15-year old after having seen some of it as a 9-year-old and if I don't rant about it real quick I swear to Glob I'm gonna die.</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/askgbor</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/askgbor</uri></author><category term="adventuretime" label="r/adventuretime"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gpvmqk/custom_adventuretime_stones/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5vp5Abh6roB4wHMHRG8YdCu2o_1sMGPssAkX7WfCcrc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Custom adventuretime Stones&quot; title=&quot;Custom adventuretime Stones&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/askgbor&quot;&gt; /u/askgbor &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/s6yykgp8kr051.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gpvmqk/custom_adventuretime_stones/&quot;&gt;[comentarios]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_gpvmqk</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gpvmqk/custom_adventuretime_stones/" /><updated>2020-05-24T19:23:38+00:00</updated><title>Custom adventuretime Stones</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/LstInterestng2LookAt</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/LstInterestng2LookAt</uri></author><category term="adventuretime" label="r/adventuretime"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gpvfla/most_underrated_at_characters_whos_yours/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/OF5z5Lg41G5oxC2D2-aj2ntN69v7e6fUcEo3XdcP3Yk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Most underrated AT characters.

I love her personality, her lore, her design, I just adore her, so any time she&amp;#39;s a major part of an episode it&amp;#39;s a point in favor of said episode. Secondly, it&amp;#39;s just such a sweet episode. Basically, LSP bites Jake, which puts him at risk of becoming a lumpy person, which would make him selfish, vain, and avaricious like the lumpy people. So Finn works with him to get the antidote before its to late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just seeing their immense concern for each other, and their inability to give up on one another is absolutely adorable. Also, Lumpy Space looks pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crossover&lt;/em&gt; (2016)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This episode is an example of perfect story telling. Prismo alerts Finn and Jake that farmworld Finn and farmworld Lich are about to activate the portal based in farmworld Enchiridion and achieve the Lich&amp;#39;s goal of killing all life. It is up to Finn and Jake to convince farmworld Finn to cease his collaborations with the Lich before all life is exterminated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crossover&lt;/em&gt; is an epic story that rejuvenates the terror the Lich has filled us with for all those years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astral Plane&lt;/em&gt; (2015)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly beautiful and insightful episode. Finn, while camping with Jake, looks upon the stars and ponders what existence is all about. As he falls asleep, the stars align so Finn&amp;#39;s soul leaves his body and travels through the local area and space, observing the existential angst of a fox, Bouncehouse Princess, and Ice King.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then ends up on Mars, and talks to Glob himself. Here, Finn learns that creation is not enough to warrant respect and fulfill the purpose of life, but to do all you can to protect your creations, as Glob sacrifices himself to save Mars from the Catalyst Comet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a beautiful message: the context of your existence is not what makes you who you are, but what you do with your existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;King Worm&lt;/em&gt; (2012)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finn experiences a nightmare in which Peppermint Butler informs Finn that he, Finn, will die if he does not kill the King Worm, and if he does not, King Worm will slowly suck the life energy from Finn. So, Finn works with Jake to find the King Worm, doing all he can to ignore his fears of the ocean, naivety, and the Lich to detach himself from the nightmare and cause King Worm to wither away, saving Finn&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a quintessential example of Adventure Time&amp;#39;s style of &amp;quot;Weird, but good.&amp;quot; Like &lt;em&gt;Astral Plane&lt;/em&gt;, it also has a really good message: Sometimes, to win a game, you just have to not play it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playdate&lt;/em&gt; (2013)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ice King is already a great character. Abracadaniel is already a great character. Seeing these two together is a recipe for an amazing episode. We watch the Ice King temporarily stay at the tree fort as Gunter rebuilds the Ice Kingdom in wake of Flame Princess destroying it, and then Finn and Jake invite Abracadaniel over in hopes of convincing Ice King to live with Abracadaniel. These two become the most adorable of friends and, in their playful mischief, accidentally send a demon after Jake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The episode is amazing not only for its incorporation of Abracadaniel and Ice King, but also for its ability to keep the two likable even after they nearly get Jake killed through gross negligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Silent King&lt;/em&gt; (2011)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finn and Jake find themselves the acting kings of goblins after their tyrannical king is overthrown by Finn and Jake. The two are treated to excessive luxury and brown-nosing, as the goblins offer to do everything for them, from making their beds to speaking for them. Finn is skeptical of this new lifestyle, and soon enrages the kingdom by taking care of his own responsibilities, as the goblins believed that the king should be completely sedentary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two abandon the kingdom after fighting off its old ruler, assuming that their view of leadership was two flawed to create a stable government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This episode has so many meanings: It could mean that authoritarianism is bad, it could mean take responsibility, or it could mean that anything in excess is bad. Any way though, it carries a good message. That&amp;#39;s why this is on my list, it has any message you want it to have, and yet any way you interpret it, it has a good message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond This Earthly Realm&lt;/em&gt; (2012)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finn has his body trapped within a small relic modeled after a lamb, leaving him an ethereal soul that only Ice King can see. As a result, Finn must work with Ice King, a man he loathes at the time of the episode, to return to his normal life. This episode teaches a wonderful Hegelian message about working with people you hate, and that its okay to dislike people, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you never interact with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Forgot Your Floaties&lt;/em&gt; (2015)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magic Man works with Betty Groff to resurrect his deceased wife, Margoles, who was killed by GOLB, (GOLB&amp;#39;s appearance along gets this episode an extra point) with the intent of turning her into a guardian of Mars so that GOLB can&amp;#39;t attack the planet again. Magic Man&amp;#39;s nostalgia for his wife, however, interferes with his work, causes the machine to crash, and makes him lose his powers, which, knowing Magic Man, might be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Forgot Your Floaties&lt;/em&gt; is about being to able to appreciate and cherish your nostalgic memories, but at the same time being able to move on and work to improve the present as a new era in history, not to make it similar to a romanticized conception of the past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freak City&lt;/em&gt; (2010)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magic Man&amp;#39;s introduction episode, he tricks Finn and Jake into giving him food, posing as a homeless beggar, so that he can turn Finn into an andromorphic foot and cause him to be shunned. Finn is then exiled to a small area where Magic Man&amp;#39;s other victims were sent to be exiled as well. The exiles, in a place demonized as &amp;quot;Freak City&amp;quot;, are depressed due to their shunning, but Finn encourages them to rise up and fight Magic Man. That&amp;#39;s just an amazing, inspirational story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simon and Marcy&lt;/em&gt; (2013)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where to begin? Ice King, especially in the early seasons of the series, has been showed to be a lascivious, rude, and socially awkward degenerate inconsiderate of others and the consequences of his actions. But this episode, along with a few others, discusses how he got to that horrible state of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marceline explains to Finn and Jake that nearly 1,000 years ago, after the Great Mushroom War, Simon Petrikov, a historian, was guiding a young girl named Marceline through the post-apocalyptic Earth. But, Petrikov owned a crown that gave him control over the force of ice, that he had to use to keep Marceline safe from nuclear mutants, but every time he wore the crown, he slipped closer and closer into insanity and Peter Pan syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Petrikov had to struggle between protecting Marceline and his own sanity, a sad, yet heart-warming story that made the greatest episode of Adventure Time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/SpiderOfSummeria&quot;&gt; /u/SpiderOfSummeria &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gq2ssb/my_top_10_favorite_episodes_of_adventure_time/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gq2ssb/my_top_10_favorite_episodes_of_adventure_time/&quot;&gt;[comentarios]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_gq2ssb</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gq2ssb/my_top_10_favorite_episodes_of_adventure_time/" /><updated>2020-05-25T02:37:06+00:00</updated><title>My Top 10 Favorite Episodes of Adventure Time</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/realToadPilzkopf</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/realToadPilzkopf</uri></author><category term="adventuretime" label="r/adventuretime"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gpv30a/does_anyone_have_this_title_screen_in_better/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/otCzYjyQvelwLfkL81mLSL34BmQ0GqjK-iUew0HR7w0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Does anyone have this title screen in better quality?&quot; title=&quot;Does anyone have this title screen in better quality?&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/realToadPilzkopf&quot;&gt; /u/realToadPilzkopf &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/xejslljner051.png&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gpv30a/does_anyone_have_this_title_screen_in_better/&quot;&gt;[comentarios]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_gpv30a</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/gpv30a/does_anyone_have_this_title_screen_in_better/" /><updated>2020-05-24T18:52:17+00:00</updated><title>Does anyone have this title screen in better quality?</title></entry></feed>
